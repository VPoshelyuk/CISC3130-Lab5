# CISC3130-Lab5
##  A local Radio DJ wants to create a sorted playlist based on the song title name. He is in a coding class learning about data structures and tries to create the playlist using a binary search tree.

### About
---
This CLI tool allows you to parse last 6 weekly CSV reports from [SpotifyCharts](https://spotifycharts.com/regional) and search for tracks using Playlist's subSet function, which takes two arguments: start and end strings and searches for every song name that is alphabetically situated in-between those.
Currently, this piece of software is shipped with 2 sample inputs but you can add as many as you like, sample output is also providedðŸ™‚.
